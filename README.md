# TASK 1:
# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
#Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
#measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
#their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
#measurements of the iris species and classify them.



# TASK 4: 
# Email spam Detection with Machine Learning
#We’ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email
#that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic
#messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.

#In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to
#train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. 


# TASK 5:
# Sales Prediction using Python
#Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors
#such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you
#advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.

#Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict
#their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their
#product. So let’s start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.
